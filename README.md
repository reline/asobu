#あそぼうよ！　Let's Play!
An android app for studying Japanese.

#Environment
Android App developed for Ice Cream Sandwich v4.04 and up.

#Project Description
Users will choose a song and then will be given the lyrics to the song with a few words blanked out. The 
users will have to fill in the blanks with the words. They’re scored on how many blank spaces they filled 
in correctly. If the user doesn’t fill in the blanks correctly in the allotted time they will either lose points 
or simply gain none. The lyrics will be synced up with the song and will scroll along as it plays.
